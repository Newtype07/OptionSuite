# OptionSuite
Options strategy backtester and live trader* framework

# Objective
The objective of the OptionSuite library was to create a general framework to backtest options strategies and to be extensible enough to handle live trading.

*Live trader is currently not supported, but the general framework is in place to expand support for live trading.

# Overview
The library is designed in a modular way, and several abstractions are provided which allow the user to add additional features.  Below, I describe the structure of the library.
